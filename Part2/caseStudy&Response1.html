                    <h3>22. Review Wilson’s first three points, listed under “Explorations” at the bottom of the page. Explain how these points show how – and why – these ideas have or have not emerged in today’s world.</h3>
                    <p>Wilson's 3 points have emerged in today's society, but not to their full extent. His 3 points emerged due to globalization and the increase of interdependence between countries. The UN is responsible for maintaining world peace. To do this, the UN maintains diplomatic relations between its constituents. To keep the oceans free for all countries, the Law of the Sea is a treaty signed by every country, which is a UN convention treaty. In Europe, open and equal trade is maintained among nations by the European Union. Outside of the EU, free trade is maintained with Iceland, Norway and Lichentenstein in the European Economic Area agreement. In summary, Wilson's first three points have emerged to a large extent.</p>
