                    <h3>23. If you were an Arab who had been promised self- government after WWI, how do you think you would have responded to the broken promises of Britain and France? How might this situation have affected your feelings of nationalism and your future attitude toward these countries? Why was controlling the Middle East related to the national interests of France and Britain after WWI? </h3>
                    <p>In that situation, I would have felt betrayed. Because there was a threat to the nation's interests, I would have mounted a rebellion, especially after acknowledging the potential fuel and resources in the territory. France and Britain would have, in turn, scramble to control the middle east after WI for their national interests. After the way, there would have been a heightened need to secure one's territories and resources to rebuild the damaged and exhausted nation. Because imperialism had not been abolished at the time, it was still part of the imperialistic nations' national interests to compete over control and influence. Lastly, it was especially important for France and Britain to control the middle east during the rise of automobiles because of the economic potential of fossil fuels. At the time, the middle east's vast oil reserves had been relatively untouched.</p>
