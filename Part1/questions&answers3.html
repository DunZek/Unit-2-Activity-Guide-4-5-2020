                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Social:
                            <ul>
                                <li>There was tension between people and animosity had grown towards the Jews as they had become the scapegoat for all of Germany's problems. Those that had been deemed undesirable were treated with contempt. German society started to become more and more ultranationalistic over the years.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
