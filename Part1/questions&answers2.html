                    <p>The expansion of territory was the foundation for many European government's foreign policy. Alliances were formed out of these foreign policies. Because the expansion of territory, or in other words imperialism, is a part of the nation's nationalism, then a nations's interest and their constituent's nationalism are important causes of war, especially when we also consider that alliances often lead other allied countries to war.</p>

                    <h3>7. Using the internet, research and record information on the impact of WWI on the Canadian home front. Describe this impact as it relates to the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Economy/Industry in Canada</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A.) WWI Had strained everyone's economy. To help finance the financial costs of the war, the income of paid workers and corporations were taxed. These taxation measures were enacted around 1914 to 1917. Other than taxes, the prices on products such as steel and coal were restrained and regulated for the war effort.</li>
                        <li>B.) WWI propaganda in Canada emphasized the need to support the war effot regardless of the occupation. Propaganda made the Canadian homefront active because it made people believe in the war. In other words, it aligned people's interest with the nation's.</li>
                        <li>C.) The role of women were important during the war time. Women were included in work areas that lacked workers such as factories in urban areas. Women were eventually allowed to vote because of their contribution. At times, women were looked upon with contempt because they were attributed to the rise of STDs. Canadian society during the war time also changed how people view certain ethnicities. Individuals who were of the same ethnicity with the enemy were suspected with affiliation with them.</li>

                    <p>The military and police can enforce the ultranationalistic policies of the government, more than otherwise due to physical force. As well, they are the medium of the government from which the government can exert power on the nation.</p>

                    <p>Younger students and audiences are more susceptible to believing an idea and taking it to heart. So when they grow up, they would know nothing else other than what they've been indoctrinated to because they have no other perspective to see the world in, especially if their education is strictly regulated.</p>

                    <p>Collectivization is the act of congregating the forfeited properties of Individuals for the state or larger nation to use. During Stalin's rule, he collectivized farms to ensure the Soviet Union could maintain a stowage of food and ensure efficient crop production. This program threatened the personal interests of people in order to uphold the bigger nation's common interests. Thus, it hurt the nationalist feelings of those people.</p>
