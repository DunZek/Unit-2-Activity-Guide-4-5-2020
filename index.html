                    <p>This website is designed as the presentation of my answers for the Unit 2 activity guide in my social class with Ms.McCormick. I thought that I should kill two birds with one stone; practice my website development skills while doing my Social 20's assigned work. Thus, I have created this informational website. Edit: 4-6-2020 (M-D-Y)</p>

                    <p>The author of this website is Duncan Ledesma, whose TA is Ms.Spina. In any case, I also made this website because I was bored during the corona virus lockdown.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Note: The questions links are designed with regards to the order of the textbook resources.</p>

                    <p>This is actually my third revision of this project. I had been experimenting with the CSS properties of flexbox and grid. In fact, the first and second versions of this website had been built around the flexbox and grid respectively. For my third however, this one, I will be using inline-block because doing so won't cause me complications whenever the navigation bar toggles.</p>

                    <p>I deployed my website from Netlify today on 9:01 PM. The Website is practically complete. I was able to make the site responsive and movile friendly. In the end, I used the grid CSS layout. There used to be a problem with the functionality of the hamburger button, but today I was able to fix it. I was also able to correspond the functionality of the hamburger button and the site's responsiveness.</p>
